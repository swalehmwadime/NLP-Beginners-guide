## Introduction
Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. You will get a variety of projects that demonstrate different techniques and methodologies used in the field.

## Projects
### Sentiment Analysis
We are typically classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Check out this [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/British-Airways-Ds) to learn more

### Text Classification
Text classification involves categorizing text into predefined categories. 
- Run notebook on [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pz_FwYLuwkwJho-swH0o8M60nYhYMFx1) 


### Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and classifying entities (such as names, dates, and locations) in text. 

### Machine Translation
Machine Translation is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another. This project explores different translation models and techniques.

## Configuration and Installation
To get started with this repository, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/swalehmwadime/NLP-Beginners-guide.git
    cd nlp-repository
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
Each project in this repository is contained within its own directory. Navigate to the desired project directory and follow the instructions in the respective README file.

Example:
```bash
cd sentiment-analysis
python train.py
```

## Data
