## Introduction
Natural Language Processing is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and humans through natural language. <br>
- Check [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) to start learning.<br>
- [Video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNxaJsNG3-s&list=PLQY2H8rRoyvzDbLUZkbudP-MFQZwNmU4S)


## Projects
### Sentiment Analysis
We are typically classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral.
- Check out this [sentiment analysis](https://github.com/swalehmwadime/British-Airways-Ds) to learn more

### Text Classification
Text classification involves categorizing text into predefined categories. 
- Run notebook on [Google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Pz_FwYLuwkwJho-swH0o8M60nYhYMFx1) 


### Named Entity Recognition
Named Entity Recognition (NER) is the process of identifying and classifying entities (such as names, dates, and locations) in text. 


### Machine Translation
Machine Translation is the task of automatically translating text from one language to another. This project explores different translation models and techniques.

### Tokenization
