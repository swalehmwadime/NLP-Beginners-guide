- Tokenization in Natural Language Processing is where we breakdown text into smaller ,meaningful units called tokens. It is about taking a string and breaking it into chunks.

## **Types of Tokenization:**

1. **Word Tokenization:** 
   * Breaks text into individual words.
   * Example: "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog." becomes ["The", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
  
2. **Character Tokenization:**
   * Breaks text into individual characters.
   * Example: "Hello" becomes ["H", "e", "l", "l", "o"]

3. **Subword Tokenization:**
   * Breaks text into subword units, such as prefixes, suffixes, or word stems.
   * Example: "running" might be tokenized as ["run", "##ing"]
     

## **Why is Tokenization Important?**

* **Machine Readability:** Tokenization allows computers to "understand" text by converting it into a numerical representation that machine learning models can work with.
* **Feature Extraction:** Tokenization helps extract meaningful features from text, such as word frequency, word order, and sentence structure, which are crucial for various NLP tasks.
* **Contextual Understanding:** Tokenization helps identify the context of words by analyzing their surrounding tokens. This is important for tasks like sentiment analysis and text classification.


**Tokenization in Practice:**

* **Search Engines:** Breaking down text into tokens helps search engines index and retrieve relevant information.
* **Sentiment Analysis:** Analyzing the sentiment of text requires understanding the meaning of individual words and their relationships.
* **Machine Translation:** Tokenization is essential for breaking down text into smaller units that can be translated independently.
* **Text Summarization:** Identifying the most important information in a text often involves understanding the meaning of individual words and their relationships.
